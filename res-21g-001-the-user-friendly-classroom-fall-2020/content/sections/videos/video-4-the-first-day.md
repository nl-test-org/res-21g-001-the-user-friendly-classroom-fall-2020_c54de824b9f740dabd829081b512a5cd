title: 'Video 4: The First Day'
transcript: '<p><span m=''13490''>GUOLONG: That is Friday in one</span> <span m=''15801''>of
  the classrooms of Building 26, 11:00 AM.</span> </p><p><span m=''19512''>MARZIEH:
  So I was quite nervous.</span> </p><p><span m=''21470''>SHAWN: The first day is
  a little bit nervous for me.</span> </p><p><span m=''24311''>CARLA: I was nervous.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''25810''>I''m not going to deny it.</span> </p><p><span m=''27899''>NARRATOR:
  Facing your students for the first time</span> <span m=''29940''>can be a little
  scary, but it''s also</span> <span m=''31870''>an opportunity to establish that
  your class will</span> <span m=''34220''>be user-friendly.</span> </p><p><span m=''35890''>BILLY:
  I think the first day of class</span> <span m=''37580''>really sets the tone for
  the rest of the semester.</span> </p><p><span m=''42170''>NARRATOR: How can you
  set the right tone?</span> </p><p><span m=''44390''>As they make their way to your
  classroom on the first day,</span> <span m=''47380''>what qualities are your students
  hoping for?</span> </p><p><span m=''49956''>BILLY: Being knowledgeable and understanding
  the concept.</span> </p><p><span m=''52330''>ADRIAN: And you need to feel that you
  can approach them.</span> </p><p><span m=''56000''>CHANDLER: Have just an air of
  confidence.</span> </p><p><span m=''57750''>ADRIAN: Being easy to understand.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''59820''>BILLY: And being enthusiastic.</span> </p><p><span m=''61311''>CHANDLER:
  Being there, having a presence,</span> <span m=''63019''>having a lesson plan ready.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''64330''>CAROL: They''re well-organized.</span> </p><p><span m=''66780''>NARRATOR:
  That may sound like a lot.</span> </p><p><span m=''68520''>Let''s start with approachability.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''70440''>ADRIAN: That is important that you feel accepted and welcomed</span>
  <span m=''74840''>in the environment.</span> </p><p><span m=''76942''>NARRATOR:
  Being approachable can be</span> <span m=''78400''>as simple as facing the class
  and smiling-- even if you feel</span> <span m=''81920''>like hiding behind your
  papers.</span> </p><p><span m=''84200''>And making eye contact.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''86590''>BILLY: Making eye contact just is a personal connection</span> <span
  m=''89760''>to the person you are talking to-- the audience in general.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''93479''>So students feel like the explanation you are making</span> <span m=''96710''>is
  for them.</span> </p><p><span m=''97432''>CAROL: It is an important form of communication</span>
  <span m=''99390''>for them to do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''100300''>It definitely
  holds the students'' attention.</span> </p><p><span m=''102360''>BILLY: In terms
  of international TAs, in general,</span> <span m=''104984''>there may be some misunderstanding</span>
  <span m=''106400''>here and there, but I think it''s important to make</span> <span
  m=''110020''>the students comfortable asking for the TA</span> <span m=''114270''>to
  repeat any word or any sentence.</span> </p><p><span m=''116300''>CAROL: I think
  at the beginning of the semester,</span> <span m=''119840''>they should maybe say
  that it''s OK for the students</span> <span m=''126080''>to ask for clarifications
  if something isn''t clear.</span> </p><p><span m=''129639''>I think that''s generally
  a good thing for all TAs</span> <span m=''133460''>to welcome any questions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''135040''>ADRIAN: Show that you are open and you</span> <span m=''139010''>care
  about the success of the students</span> <span m=''142550''>that you are trying
  to teach.</span> </p><p><span m=''146360''>NARRATOR: Enthusiasm is another way</span>
  <span m=''147930''>to show your students your class will be friendly.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''151074''>BILLY: Being enthusiastic and showing that you''re actually</span>
  <span m=''153490''>passionate about the material you</span> <span m=''154865''>are
  teaching-- that also gives a little more comfortable</span> <span m=''159730''>atmosphere
  during recitation.</span> </p><p><span m=''161180''>CAROL: I think TAs who are excited
  about what they''re</span> <span m=''164560''>teaching-- or if what they''re teaching</span>
  <span m=''166930''>is very specific to their research--</span> <span m=''169440''>you
  can tell that they want to teach it</span> <span m=''171976''>and they want you
  to learn it because they''re</span> <span m=''173850''>very excited about it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''174840''>Then the student is probably going to be more engaged.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''179290''>NARRATOR: And before any other quality,</span> <span m=''180970''>students
  say they want knowledge,</span> <span m=''183220''>but they''re also confident you''ll
  have it.</span> </p><p><span m=''185746''>CAROL: I think I personally trust</span>
  <span m=''187120''>that MIT has selected fine TAs to teach us the material.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''192840''>NARRATOR: So on the first day, rather</span> <span m=''194420''>than
  trying to impress the students,</span> <span m=''196410''>stick with the simple
  explanation of why you are</span> <span m=''198940''>a good fit to teach the class.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''201930''>GUOLONG: I''m a third-year grad student in the department</span>
  <span m=''205190''>of [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p><p><span m=''207090''>I''m working
  with Professor Oppenheim, who is also</span> <span m=''210360''>the lecturer of
  this class.</span> </p><p><span m=''213700''>NARRATOR: Students also want TAs to
  show self-confidence.</span> </p><p><span m=''216075''>CAROL: When I think of confidence
  in a TA,</span> <span m=''217824''>I think of someone who is very-- they come off
  as, OK, I</span> <span m=''220800''>know this material better than you,</span> <span
  m=''222650''>and I''m going to teach it to you.</span> </p><p><span m=''224090''>So
  often, I think TAs who speak not super fast and just pretty</span> <span m=''230040''>articulate
  and slower, so that their point gets across,</span> <span m=''233430''>usually I
  feel more sure that they''re pretty</span> <span m=''237027''>good at explaining
  things.</span> </p><p><span m=''238110''>BILLY: The speed you have when you talk
  in a conversation,</span> <span m=''240950''>just divide that by two.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''242555''>And just because you''re nervous in front of people,</span> <span m=''244680''>the
  speed will increase either way.</span> </p><p><span m=''246470''>So, speaking a
  little bit more slowly</span> <span m=''249120''>helps a lot because you can also
  have the time</span> <span m=''253170''>to think about what you''re saying,</span>
  <span m=''254700''>and the audience and the students you''re speaking to</span>
  <span m=''257300''>will have a better time understanding, especially</span> <span
  m=''259519''>if pronunciation or if you have a certain accent.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''262870''>NARRATOR: So, speed makes a difference</span> <span m=''264700''>in
  how students see you.</span> </p><p><span m=''266840''>What about volume?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''268830''>SHAWN: In a big classroom, I definitely</span> <span m=''271220''>have
  to remind myself that I have to raise</span> <span m=''273960''>my voice a little
  bit louder.</span> </p><p><span m=''275830''>NARRATOR: Speaking too quietly can
  also</span> <span m=''277820''>give the impression of nervousness.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''279659''>GUOLONG: This week''s lecture focuses</span> <span m=''281430''>on
  sampling rate conversion.</span> </p><p><span m=''285490''>NARRATOR: A stronger
  voice projects confidence</span> <span m=''287780''>and commands attention.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''290070''>GUOLONG: This week''s lecture focuses</span> <span m=''291850''>on
  sampling rate conversion.</span> </p><p><span m=''295014''>NARRATOR: Getting to
  the classroom early</span> <span m=''296680''>can also help you to feel more confident,
  because you</span> <span m=''299070''>can get to know the students before you start
  teaching.</span> </p><p><span m=''303260''>And planning ahead not only makes</span>
  <span m=''305110''>you feel more confident, it also makes</span> <span m=''307640''>students
  confident in you.</span> </p><p><span m=''310280''>CAROL: So, I think one TA that
  I had--</span> <span m=''313860''>when I think of a user-friendly class, I think
  of his class,</span> <span m=''317380''>because every day he had his recitation
  planned</span> <span m=''322560''>to the minute-- which is pretty ridiculous--</span>
  <span m=''324480''>but it actually was very logical in a way that</span> <span m=''328612''>helped
  the students learn.</span> </p><p><span m=''329695''>So he would pretty much write
  the agenda on the blackboard.</span> </p><p><span m=''334740''>Like from minute
  zero to minute five,</span> <span m=''336666''>we''re going to take a quiz.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''337790''>And from minute five to minute 10,</span> <span m=''339240''>we''re
  going to talk about the quiz.</span> </p><p><span m=''340950''>If they seem like
  they''re well-organized-- they have</span> <span m=''344130''>their papers in a
  nice, little folder--</span> <span m=''347040''>I definitely look at that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''348342''>CHANDLER: Having a real lesson plan</span> <span m=''349800''>and
  showing that there''s going to productivity</span> <span m=''351716''>in the recitations
  is important.</span> </p><p><span m=''353280''>Having someone prepared shows that
  they</span> <span m=''354980''>were thinking about us when we weren''t in class.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''358560''>NARRATOR: Finally, international teaching assistants</span>
  <span m=''361220''>also stress preparation and planning</span> <span m=''363600''>in
  their advice for a successful first day.</span> </p><p><span m=''366840''>SHAWN:
  As an international teaching assistant,</span> <span m=''370080''>we have some disadvantages
  probably</span> <span m=''372620''>compared to native speakers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''374840''>But if we are prepared, if we show our enthusiasm</span> <span m=''379500''>towards
  the subject, I think the students</span> <span m=''381800''>will feel them as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''383045''>CARLA: Just be prepared.</span> </p><p><span m=''384670''>That''s
  what speaks scores about you-- if you''re very prepared.</span> </p><p><span m=''387992''>MARZIEH:
  I went through all the notes,</span> <span m=''390200''>all the books that are related
  to the course.</span> </p><p><span m=''393450''>And I tried to prepare some good
  examples.</span> </p><p><span m=''397940''>GUOLONG: I think for that class,</span>
  <span m=''399770''>I did over-preparation that if I discussed everything</span>
  <span m=''407000''>on my notebook, it would take two hours instead of one hour.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''410310''>So I think never running out of materials</span> <span
  m=''413570''>seems another source of my confidence.</span> </p><p><span m=''418889''>CARLA:
  I should be confident enough just</span> <span m=''421180''>by the sake of being
  the TA.</span> </p><p><span m=''423080''>You shouldn''t be nervous because you do
  know more</span> <span m=''425430''>about the topic than they do.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''428110''>MARZIEH: It was challenging, but in a good way.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''431246''>SHAWN: Get everything prepared.</span> </p><p><span m=''433520''>Do
  your best.</span> </p><p></p>'
