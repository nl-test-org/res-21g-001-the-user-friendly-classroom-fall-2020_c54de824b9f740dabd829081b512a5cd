The User-friendly Classroom video training series was created specifically for teaching assistants for whom English is a second language and the USA a second culture by A.C. Kemp, a lecturer in [MIT Global Languages](http://mitgsl.mit.edu/).Â  These videos focus on developing international teaching assistants' strategies for successful, student-centered communication in the interactive American classroom. These videos demonstrate best practices through authentic examples of successful teaching scenarios, interviews with undergraduates and advice from international teaching assistants.

These videos were created for use with the following courses:

[21G.232](/courses/21g-232-advanced-speaking-and-critical-listening-skills-els-spring-2007/) / [21G.233](/courses/21g-232-advanced-speaking-and-critical-listening-skills-els-spring-2007/) Advanced Speaking and Critical Listening (ELS)

21G.217 / 21G.218 Workshop in Strategies for Effective Teaching (ELS)
